**Melbourne Open Data Playground**
==================================
Last Updated: 13-Dec-2021

An initiative of the [Deakin University Industry Student Capstone (DISC) Program](https://www.discprojects.com/) for the [City of Melbourne](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/).

# About

Welcome to the Melbourne Open Data Playground GitHub community page.

Melbourne Open Data Playground (MOP) is a capstone project sponsored by Deakin University.

Since Covid there has been greater demand for data by the business community to support their decision making. This project is designed to align with and support two strategic imperitives from City of Melbourne Council being:

- **The Economic Development Strategy to be a digitally-connected city, and**
- **The 2021-2025 Council Plan which outlines the specific objective of delivering programs that will build digital literacy skills and capabilities.**

The City of Melbourne has been an Australian leader in Open Data since 2014.

Through research and local community engagement, the City of Melbourne has identified two key gaps in community knowledge of open data, these being:
- an understanding of how to access Open Data, and
- how to gain insights from the data in support of application development and finding solutions to city problems.

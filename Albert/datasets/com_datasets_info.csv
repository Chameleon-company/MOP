0,Pedestrian Counting System - Monthly (counts per hour),b2ak-trbp,[],"This dataset contains hourly pedestrian counts since 2009 from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated on a monthly basis and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.
<p>The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href=""https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/Pedestrian-Counting-System-Sensor-Locations/h57g-5234"">Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations</a> dataset which details the location, status and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting pedestrian counts over time.
<p><b>Importants notes about this dataset:</b>
<br>•	Where no pedestrians have passed underneath a sensor during an hour, a count of zero will be shown for the sensor for that hour. 
<br>•	Directional readings are not included, though we hope to make this available later in the year.  Directional readings are provided in the <a href="" https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/d/d6mv-s43h"">Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)</a> dataset.

<b>How the data joins:</b>
There are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions. 
The way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don’t currently join.

<b>Field information:</b>
- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive. (1-5=Monday to Friday)
- StartTime: The time each day when the restriction applies.
- EndTime: The time each day when the restriction ends.
- TypeDesc: The type of restriction. Eg: ""2P Meter"" (two hour parking, paid for using a meter), ""Disabled Only"" (only vehicles with disabiled permits can park).
- Description: A compact, human-readable description of the overall restrictions. TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces
- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).
- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.
- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.
- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.

There can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times. Each restriction is a set of columns with a number: FromDay1, ToDay1, StartTime1, EndTime1, etc.

A business establishment is defined as a

29,Pedestrian Counting System - Past Hour (counts per minute),d6mv-s43h,[],"<b>Current issue 23/09/2020</b>
Please note: Sensors 67, 68 and 69 are showing duplicate records. We are currently working on a fix to resolve this.

This dataset contains minute by minute directional pedestrian counts for the last hour from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated every 15 minutes and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.
<p>The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with the Sensor Locations dataset which details the location, status and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.
<p>Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every minute as sensor devices only create a record when one or more pedestrians have passed underneath the sensor.

<p>Since the inauguration of the <a href=""https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/city-population/Pages/pedestrian-counting-system.aspx"">Pedestrian Counting System</a> in 2009, some sensor devices have been removed or relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works. Others may be inactive due to a temporary issue. This is detailed in the notes column.  Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.
<p>Sensors are typically installed under an awning or on a street pole to form a counting zone on the footpath below. They record bi-directional pedestrian movements through the zone, 24 hours, every day. Locations are selected based on three criteria – retail and event activity, regular pedestrian use and the egress and entry flow to these areas. The system records movements, not images, so no individual information is collected.  New sensor devices have been recently installed, with more to come in the near future as part of the city’s commitment to expanding the system.

The numbers of vehicles are recorded per hour and split into 12 categories based on the Austroads vehicle classification. Vehicle class 13 is used when the type of vehicle can’t be determined.

In the 2017/16 surveys all bikes, motorcycles and maximum speeds were captured. In the 2015 surveys not all surveys captured bikes, motorcycles and maximum speed. In the 2014 surveys no bikes, motorcycles or maximum speed were captured.

This data is designed to be joined to the road corridor data on road_segment and seg_id. Some records have more than one road segment this is because the survey crosses intersecting roads and the intersections have a road segment number. In the Road corridor table some road segments will have the same seg_id.

35,On-street Car Parking Sensor Data - 2017,u9sa-j86i,[],"The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.


Known data issues: 

1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: 

· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. 

· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. 

2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. 

3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. 

Data that is excluded:

38,2018 Building Footprints,pq2z-35fu,[],"This dataset shows the footprints of all structures within the City of Melbourne. A building footprint is a 2D polygon (or multi-polygon) representation of the base of a building or structure. The footprint is defined as the boundary of the structure where the walls intersect with the ground plane or podium, rather than an outline of the roof area (roofprint).

Where a building has a significant change in built form, multiple footprint polygons are ‘stacked’ vertically to define shape of the built form. This includes, and is not limited to:

- Tower
- Podium
- Setbacks/offsets

Reporting to the standard allows cities to compare their service delivery and quality of life to other cities globally. The City of Melbourne was one on 20 cities to, globally to help pilot this program and is one of sixteen cities to receive the highest level of accreditation (platinum). 
Having an international standard methodology to measure city performance allows the City of Melbourne to share data about practices in service delivery, learn from other global cities, rank its results relative to those cities, and address common challenges through more informed decision making. 
Indicators include: Fire and emergency response; Governance; Health; Recreation; Safety; Shelter; Solid Waste; Telecommunications and Innovation; Transportation; Urban Planning; Wastewater; Water and Sanitation; Economy; Education; Energy; Environment; and Finance.
City of Melbourne also submitted an application for accreditation, on behalf of ‘Greater Melbourne’, to the World Council on City Data and this resulted in an ‘Aspirational’ accreditation awarded to wider Melbourne.

42,Laneways with greening potential,s8dq-xd4g,[],"This dataset includes City of Melbourne’s mapping of greening potential in laneways across the municipality. 'Greening' in this dataset refers to four types of possible greening responses: forest lanes, farm lanes, park lanes and vertical gardens. Higher gridcodes indicate lower potential for adaptation - i.e. a gridcode of 1 is optimal.

This dataset can be used the general public, developers, landscape architects and other interested parties who want to know what the future of green laneways may look like for Melbourne. This dataset can be used as a starting point for greening projects including forest, farm and park lanes as well as vertical gardens

Anyone interested in potential greening within the city should contact the City of Melbourne or visit the Green Infrastructure webpages found on the <a href=""https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/community/greening-the-city/green-infrastructure/Pages/green-roofs-walls-facades.aspx/""> City of Melboune website here</a>. The <a href=""https://www.growinggreenguide.org/"">Growing Green Guide</a> is another helpful and comprehensive guide for the building and maintaining green roofs, walls and facades in Melbourne and Victoria.

The Laneways with greening potential dataset is part of a larger suite of work by City of Melbourne to explore and implement contemporary and unique ways of greening in the city that can help combat increased urban density and loss of public open space.

44,Business establishments per block by CLUE industry,c3gt-hrz6,[],"Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2002-19. It shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation.

A business establishment is defined as a 
•	Commercial occupant in a building 
•	Separate land use 
•	Any permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).
Hence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.

67,Microclimate Sensor Readings,u4vh-84j8,[],"This dataset contains environmental readings from microclimate sensors located across the city. The data is updated every hour in fifteen minute increments and can be used to determine variations in microclimate changes throughout the day. Microclimate data includes:
- Ambient air temperature
- Relative humidity
- Barometric pressure
- Particulate matter 2.5
- Particulate matter 10
- Average wind speed

The Microclimate Sensor Readings helps us to understand temperature, relative humidity, pressure, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, and average wind speed at different locations and different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future. 

Additional values are included in this dataset to provide an easier way to correlate the data with the official EPA Victoria data. These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages . This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. 

The site_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Mircoclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4' target='_blank'>Sensor Locations dataset</a> which contain the sensor location. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical microclimate data.

Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every 15 minutes as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site. 

For the description of each sensor please see the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/api/views/u4vh-84j8/files/5b981d2b-f137-40d4-9c91-53d7b0504d11?download=true&filename=MicroClimateSensors_Metadata_Attachment_DataDictionary.pdf' target='_blank'>sensor type attachment</a>.

A business establishment is defined as a

•	Separate land use
•	Any permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).

Hence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.

86,On-street Car Parking Sensor Data - 2016,dj7e-rdx9,[],"The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2016 calendar year.


Known data issues: 

1. There are 342,475 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: 

· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. 

· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. 

2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. 

3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.

109,Count of business establishments per industry for blocks 2019,md5d-vpap,['c3gt-hrz6'],"Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2019. It shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their industry (ANZSIC1) and small area allocation. Yearly totals are denoted as being in block '0' and are in a shaded row.

A business establishment is defined as a 
•	Commercial occupant in a building 
•	Separate land use 
•	Any permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).
Hence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.

120,Business establishments per block by ANZSIC,jsun-ttri,[],"Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2002-19. It shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation.

A business establishment is defined as a 
•	Commercial occupant in a building 
•	Separate land use 
•	Any permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).
Hence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.

128,"Bird Survey Results for Areas in the City of Melbourne, February and March 2018",6cxw-5y4y,[],"This dataset contains survey data for bird species across various river and wetland locations in the City of Melbourne. Bird transect surveys were conducted by Ecology Australia at the following locations: Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Wildlife Sanctuary (1), Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Tidal Drain (2), Moonee Ponds Creek lower catchment near Racecourse Road, Kensington and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (3), Maribyrnong River near Newells Paddock and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (4), Royal Park Oak Street Wetland (5), and Stony Creek Backwash, Footscray (6). Surveys were undertaken during daylight hours and were repeated on various dates throughout February and March 2018. Bird surveys were conducted by completing transects along the waterbodies and identifying bird species and numbers. These surveys were undertaken to primarily track bird species richness at Site (1) with Site (3) existing as a reference site with comparable habitat characteristics.

This bird survey dataset includes the bird’s common name, scientific name, the corresponding Victorian Biodiversity Atlas Code, the date the survey was conducted, and the location of the survey (including the latitude and longitude). The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA) is managed by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and provides a list of species observations in Victoria. Each species has an identification ‘code’ number.

146,City of Melbourne Municipal Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2013-2020,q3ni-rkmu,[],"This dataset contains the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) from activities taking place within the geographic boundary of the City of Melbourne Local Government Area. 

The City of Melbourne uses the <a href=""https://ghgprotocol.org/greenhouse-gas-protocol-accounting-reporting-standard-cities"" target=""_blank"">Global Protocol for communities (GPC)</a>  method to measure and report municipal greenhouse emissions. Emissions are reported annually through the <a href=""https://www.cdp.net/en"" target=""_blank"">Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</a> platform, which is a requirement of Global Covenant of Mayors and C40 membership. 

Emission sources are broken down across the sectors: Stationary energy, Transportation and Waste. They are categorized by their ""scope"" which distinguishes between emissions that physically occur within the city (scope 1), from those that occur from the use of electricity and supplied by grids potentially crossing city boundaries (scope 2), from those that occur outside the city but are driven by activities taking place within the city’s boundaries (scope 3). All GHG emissions are presented in units of metric tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e).
 
In cases where there are limitations on data availability notation keys have been used. NO indicates that an activity or process does not occur or exist within the city. IE signifies GHG emissions for this activity are presented in another category of the inventory. NE is used when emissions occur but have not been estimated or reported due to unavailability of data.

Preparing and reporting this data helps us to understand where the city's emissions come from. It allows us to plan our emission reduction activities to take effective action to mitigate climate change.",2021-06-28T01:57:30.000Z,2020-07-29T06:45:27.000Z,2021-06-28 01:57:30+00:00,2021-06-28 01:55:48+00:00,"{'page_views_last_week': 15, 'page_views_last_month': 35, 'page_views_total': 916, 'page_views_last_week_log': 4.0, 'page_views_last_month_log': 5.169925001442312, 'page_views_total_log': 9.840777923595054}","['emissions_from_industrial', 'area_km2', 'residential_buildings_scope_1', 'commercial_and_institutional_1', 'commercial_and_institutional_2', 'manufacturing_industries', 'manufacturing_industries_1', 'manufacturing_industries_2', 'energy_industries_scope_1', 'energy_industries_scope_3', 'agriculture_forestry_and', 'agriculture_forestry_and_1', 'agriculture_forestry_and_2', 'non_specified_sources_scope', 'non_specified_sources_scope_1', 'non_specified_sources_scope_2', 'fugitive_emissions_from_mining', 'fugitive_emissions_from_oil', 'on_road_transportation_scope_1', 'on_road_transportation_scope_2', 'railways_scope_1', 'waterborne_navigation_scope_2', 'aviation_scope_2', 'aviation_scope_3', 'off_road_transportation_scope_1', 'off_road_transportation_scope_2', 'solid_waste_generated_in', 'solid_waste_generated_in_2', 'biological_waste_generated', 'biological_waste_generated_1', 'biological_waste_generated_2', 'incinerated_and_burned_waste', 'wastewater_generated_in_the', 'wastewater_generated_in_the_2', 'emissions_from_product_use', 'emissions_from_livestock', 'emissions_from_land_scope', 'other_scope_3_scope_3', 'yarra_trams_power_purchase', 'mrep1_and_mrep2_power_purchase_agreement', 'year', 'population', 'gdp_m', 'residential_buildings_scope', 'residential_buildings_scope_2', 'commercial_and_institutional', 'energy_industries_scope_2', 'energy_generation_supplied', 'on_road_transportation_scope', 'railways_scope_2', 'railways_scope_3', 'waterborne_navigation_scope', 'waterborne_navigation_scope_1', 'aviation_scope_1', 'off_road_transportation_scope', 'solid_waste_generated_in_1', 'incinerated_and_burned_waste_1', 'incinerated_and_burned_waste_2', 'wastewater_generated_in_the_1', 'emissions_from_aggregate']","['Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Checkbox', 'Checkbox', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Number', 'Number', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Number', 'Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Text']","['Emissions from industrial processes occurring in the city boundary', 'Municipality area in square kilometres ', 'Emissions from grid-supplied electricity consumed by residential market segment within the city boundary', 'Emissions from grid-supplied electricity consumed by commercial market segment within the city boundary', 'Transmission and distribution losses from grid-supplied energy to commercial buildings', 'missions from natural gas consumption by Industrialmarket segment within the city boundary', 'Emissions from grid-supplied electricity consumed by industrial market segment within the city boundary', 'ransmission and distribution losses from grid-supplied energy to industrial buildings', 'Emissions from fuel combustion within the city boundary for the purpose of energy production and energy use in energy industries.

176,On-street Car Parking Sensor Data - 2011,vkxi-k7ps,[],"The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2011 calendar year

Known data issues: 

1.There are 488,167 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: 

· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. 

· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. 

2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. 

3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.",2019-11-19T22:18:36.000Z,2017-11-27T17:03:42.000Z,2019-11-19 22:18:36+00:00,2019-04-09 06:20:02+00:00,"{'page_views_last_week': 5, 'page_views_last_month': 7, 'page_views_total': 638, 'page_views_last_week_log': 2.584962500721156, 'page_views_last_month_log': 3.0, 'page_views_total_log': 9.319672120946995}","['streetid', 'side_of_street', 'departuretime', 'betweenstreet2', 'arrivaltime', 'vehicle_present', 'sign', 'durationseconds', 'betweenstreet1', 'deviceid', 'streetmarker', 'in_violation', 'streetname', 'area']","['Number', 'Number', 'Calendar date', 'Text', 'Calendar date', 'Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Text', 'Number', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text']","['A GIS key that describes the street segment where the sensor is located.

A business establishment is defined as a

Known data issues: 

1. There are 1,139,275 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: 

· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. 

· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. 

2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. 

3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded.

202,On-street Car Parking Sensor Data - 2013,7jq6-k9kf,[],"The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2013 calendar year

Known data issues: 

1. There are 987,179 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: 

· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. 

· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. 

2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. 

3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.",2019-11-19T22:17:21.000Z,2017-12-19T17:18:50.000Z,2019-11-19 22:17:21+00:00,2019-04-16 03:19:33+00:00,"{'page_views_last_week': 3, 'page_views_last_month': 12, 'page_views_total': 400, 'page_views_last_week_log': 2.0, 'page_views_last_month_log': 3.700439718141092, 'page_views_total_log': 8.647458426454921}","['streetmarker', 'vehicle_present', 'side_of_street', 'betweenstreet2', 'deviceid', 'streetid', 'in_violation', 'arrivaltime', 'departuretime', 'streetname', 'durationseconds', 'sign', 'area', 'betweenstreet1']","['Text', 'Text', 'Number', 'Text', 'Number', 'Number', 'Text', 'Calendar date', 'Calendar date', 'Text', 'Number', 'Text', 'Text', 'Text']","['The street marker that is located next to the parking bay with a unique id for the bay.

ArborCarbon collected high resolution multispectral imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. ArborCarbon have used this multispectral image to create this seamless 20cm false-colour composite showing variation in vegetation condition.

The multispectral imagery was acquired at 8,000ft above ground level over the City of Melbourne under cloudless conditions between 09:45 and 12:45 on 2nd and 3rd February 2019. 

Imagery was acquired with the ArborCam system with a ground sample distance ranging from 6 cm/pixel to 25 cm/pixel dependent on the band.
